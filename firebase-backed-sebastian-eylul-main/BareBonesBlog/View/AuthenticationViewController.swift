/**
 * AuthenticationViewController is a SwiftUI “wrapper” around the view controller object
 * provided by FirebaseUI. The mechanism shown here is actually pretty standardized
 * and can be use to “SwiftUI-ize” any other code that is implemented as a view
 * conroller rather than as a SwiftUI View.
 *
 * Some useful links for this approach:
