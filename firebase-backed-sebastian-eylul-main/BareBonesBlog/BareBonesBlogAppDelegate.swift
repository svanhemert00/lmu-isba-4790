/**
 * BareBonesBlogAppDelegate sets up the Firebase SDK for communication with your
 * project. It does this via the UIApplicationDelegate protocol, which provides
 * a mechanism for executing application-level code that isn’t covered directly by
 * SwiftUI. The Firebase documentation uses this mechanism to get your app going
 * with Firebase. Take a look at BareBonesBlogApp to see how this “delegate” is
 * connected to the SwiftUI app itself.
 *
 * For a few more details, look at this brief item from Hacking with Swift:
 *     https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-add-an-appdelegate-to-a-swiftui-app
