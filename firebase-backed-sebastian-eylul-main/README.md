**CMSI 2022** Mobile Application Development, Spring 2022

# Assignment 0405
With this assignment, we fill out the stack, transitioning from using someone else‚Äôs web services to building your own. There are many ways to do this, and for this course, we have chosen [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) to introduce you to these layers. As with any back-end development, with Firebase we hope you‚Äôll demonstrate:
* The ability to set up and configure a Firebase project
* The ability to hook up a database (in this case Firestore) to an iOS SwiftUI mobile application
* The ability to enable and use one or more authentication methods
* The ability to set up Firebase security policies
* Continued advancement in SwiftUI app development

## Background Reading
All prior documentation continues to be useful here. The [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/) merit explicit mention again, particularly as you encounter more mobile app use cases, features, and interactions.

It should be no surprise that the big additions to the document pile involve Firebase:
* https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup: Setting up Firebase for iOS
* https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth: Introduction to Firebase authentication
* https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore: Introduction to Firestore
* https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules: Introduction to Firebase security rules
* [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/master/SwiftPackageManager.md) is the recommended mechanism for adding Firebase libraries to your Xcode project
* The main Firebase package is the Firebase iOS SDK: Keep these [iOS/Swift reference documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/swift/firebasecore/api/reference/Classes) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk) links handy
* Another useful package (especially for authentication) is FirebaseUI: Here is its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS) and [documentation for sign-in](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/firebaseui)
* NetNinja has a [Firebase Firestore tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB) that is web/JavaScript-centric‚Äîstill, the concepts are the same; you‚Äôll just have to convert their code examples to the [iOS/Swift equivalents](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/swift/firebasefirestore/api/reference/Classes)

Note that not all Firebase documentation is consistently up-to-date‚Äîsome docs will reference older technologies and if so, some work may be involved in adapting those to our current stack. Remember that we are in the world of _SwiftUI_ apps‚Äîyou may see references to other frameworks such as UIKit, Storyboard, Interface Builder, and others. Note also that Swift Package Manager is relatively new; the iOS ecosystem used to rely on third-party solutions such as CocoaPods or Carthage for package management. Some Firebase docs still refer to those, and if you see that, make sure stay with Swift Package Manager instead.

## For Submission
Create a blog mobile app using Firestore for persistence and Firebase Auth for authentication. You have been given a [starter/sample bare-bones blog app project](https://classroom.github.com/a/rk1OqpJQ) but you are under no obligation to use that code as given‚Äîfeel free to pick and choose from it to build a blog app your way. Make it as amazing as can be in terms of features and look-and-feel. Explore the possibilities‚Äîunleash your creativity!

Note that this is not a suggestion üòà Make sure that your blog app goes well beyond the given bare-bones version. Some ideas:
* Expand article data: lots of potential here, such as adding tags, categories, loglines, sectioning, etc.‚Äîall of these will require deeper knowledge of the [Firestore data model](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model)
* Filter/search articles: welcome to the world of [querying](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries)
* Categorize/group articles: yes, still querying, with some [ordering and limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/order-limit-data)
* Page through articles: [actually a necessity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/query-cursors) as your article counts grow‚Äîwith some interesting user interface options though, ranging from classic previous/next buttons to [infinite scroll](https://swiftuirecipes.com/blog/infinite-scroll-list-in-swiftui)
* Update articles: similarly, this corresponds to [updating documents](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#update-data)
* Delete articles: that‚Äôs a specific case of [deleting data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/delete-data)
* Allow photo uploads or attachments: you will want to learn about [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/ios/start) on the back end and [image access](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/importing-an-image-into-swiftui-using-phpickerviewcontroller) on the front end
* Add user metadata (e.g., photos, profile, links, etc.): just a specific case of expanding your document structure, but this one may involve [additional collections and more documents](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#collections)
* Implement rich text editing: this one is a [SwiftUI deep dive](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-implement-a-wysiwyg-editor-in-swiftui-c60236749943) but may be worth it
* Support Touch ID/Face ID: this breaks you away from the premade FirebaseUI views into [direct invocation of Firebase authentication functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/start) which you would call after [using Touch ID or Face ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/logging_a_user_into_your_app_with_face_id_or_touch_id) with [SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/using-touch-id-and-face-id-with-swiftui). This can go [quite deep if you want a completely secure solution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication#overview)‚Äîfor this assignment, it‚Äôs OK to go with something rudimentary (though it won‚Äôt hurt to read through that last link to get the big picture)
* Support [links in articles](https://www.appcoda.com/swiftui-wkwebview/) that go to the web browser or an embedded web view
* Support additional methods, whether [via FirebaseUI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/firebaseui#set_up_sign-in_methods) or [through direct SDK calls](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/start#next_steps)‚Äînote that some of these will require additional configuration or packages

Add _at least three (3)_ features beyond what is provided by the starter blog app. Additional features will earn extra credit based on the sophistication of those features.

As you can see above, starter links for these features are provided but don‚Äôt hesitate to find others. As always, if you use any content directly from a source, _make sure to credit the source_. Note also that there isn‚Äôt enough time to cover all of these in class so some self-study will be called for. This is by design because it corresponds to what one typically does in industry or research.

Notice how the Firebase SDKs abstract out the inner details of interacting with Firebase and expose Firebase functionality to your mobile app by way of ‚Äúplain‚Äù classes, objects, methods, and functions. Now you have a ‚Äúprofessional example‚Äù of what you were asked to do with your generic API network code. Similarly, you will also be best off if you abstract the _Firebase functionality_ away from the rest of your app code. This puts you in a position to transition away more easily in case you change your back end to something other than Firebase.

As before, continue to reinforce and build upon the skills you have already learned:
* Use of model objects to separate data from presentation‚Äînow matched up to your Firebase Firestore documents!
* Retrieval from and interaction with the Firebase back end
* Abstraction of Firebase operations behind classes, objects, methods, and functions (async where appropriate)
* Appropriate user interface feedback for operations-in-progress
* Correct error handling with messaging to the user when appropriate
* Effective layout via proper composition of stacks, spacers, padding, and other SwiftUI features
* Appealing color choices and visuals‚Äîdemonstrate your mastery of views and their properties (without violating any iOS Human Interface Guidelines üòÖ)
* Proper choice of input views and controls
* Well-chosen animations or transitions beyond the standard SwiftUI view behaviors
* Well-chosen programmed graphics using paths, gradients, and related functions
* Custom app icon

Supply a simple _about.md_ Markdown file that describes your blog app briefly. Make sure to _state and elaborate on the three (3) or more features_ that go beyond the bare bones starter/sample code. Also include a copy of the _production_ security policy that you implemented for your database.

## Operational Tips/Suggestions
* Note again that the wealth of possibilities means that self-study and experimentation are built into the work involved with this assignment. Make sure to plan accordingly! If you are partnered up, learning the material together may help, with multiple eyes looking at the same documentation
* Take advantage of the very distinct layers involved here: the back end (Firebase) and the front end (SwiftUI). To keep the learning manageable, try to look at each layer in isolation‚Äîsee if you can first get the Firebase side to work without any visual interface, possibly just printing things and/or inspecting the Firebase Console. _Then_ build the user interface on top of it knowing that the back end functionality already works. Or vice versa, if the user interface part looks tricker
* You may make mistakes, change your mind about features, or run into a dead end, all of which will take time‚Äîideally, _build that time in_ when planning out how you will work on the app
* Many operational tips and suggestions from the past assignments also still apply‚Äîdon‚Äôt hestitate to review them!

## How to Turn it In
